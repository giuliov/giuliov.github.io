The first and foremost reason is the complexity induced by Jekyll &amp;nbsp; . It requires some GB (who says that Visual Studio is big?) and many vodoo hacks to work on Windows. I ended having a Linux VM running Jekyll and some additional steps going from the Markdown file to a published post.</description></item><item><title>New look, but there is more</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/18/new-blog-look/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/18/new-blog-look/</guid><description>What you see today is not a simple change in style, but a complete migration from WordPress to a static site.
The main driver for this decision is the disliked for LiveWriter or in-browser editor and conversely my growing reliance on Markdown. I tried using WordPress plugins for MD, like Mytory Markdown &amp;nbsp; , but the result was never satisfactory, as they do not support Github syntax.
So I moved from a basic AWS machine (see How I set-up this blog ), to a static web site on Azure.</description></item><item><title>How I set-up this blog</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/01/03/how-i-set-up-this-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/01/03/how-i-set-up-this-blog/</guid><description>It is amazing how easy is setting up your own environment, nowadays.
I am trying new Technologies now and, knowing Azure, I was curious about Amazon. Well, it is more or less the same amount of work: create an account, choose from the Marketplace a VM configured with a blog engine and, voilà, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go. Some will turn up their nose on my choice of Wordpress, but I considered how easy is to create and move the content.</description></item></channel></rss>
