The Options You have three options: the REST API, the tf.exe vc command or &amp;hellip; we will see.
Option 1 – REST API My first attempt relied on a Powershell script to download the files from TFVC using REST API. It worked but performance is not that great as you have to download a file at a time in a loop.</description></item><item><title>Command line tool to manage Git repositories in TFS</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2015/04/24/git-repo-management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2015/04/24/git-repo-management/</guid><description>In a previous post , I quickly touched on TfsGitAdmin.
I published the code on GitHub at https://github.com/giuliov/TfsGitAdmin and added new features to it:
Adds an additional Git repository to a Team Project Creates the default Git repository on a Team Project that was created without version control Deletes an existing Git repository List all Git repositories in a Team Project Renames an existing Git repository Some Usage Examples TfsGitAdmin add -s http://localhost:8080/tfs -c DefaultCollection -p MySampleProject -r MyAdditionalGitRepository Adds an additional Git repository to Team Project MySampleProject.</description></item><item><title>Automating TeamProject creation (Git included)</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/28/automating-project-creation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/28/automating-project-creation/</guid><description>I get frequent request from my teams to create a new project, therefore I automated the task with a PowerShell script.
PowerShell Creation scripts The script algorithm goes like this:
Load the definition for the new project Validate the definition by checking the user accounts invoke the creation tool with the /validate option Creates the project using TFPT &amp;nbsp; Creates an Organizational Unit in Active Directory where placing the groups Creates the AD groups and add the user account Creates corresponding TFS groups Checks that user account belongs to one of the three AD groups that control the TFS Access Level — best known as Licensing I will spare you the code here as it is more than 100 lines long.</description></item></channel></rss>
