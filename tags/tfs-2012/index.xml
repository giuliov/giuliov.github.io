The limit of the latter solution is in the version number appearing in the assemblies: they have no relation with build identifiers.</description></item><item><title>Increment Version for Changed Assemblies only – Second Part</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/25/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-second-part/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/25/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-second-part/</guid><description>In the previous post we have seen how to hook into the MSBuild process, common to both the Visual Studio and the Team Foundation Server build processes. Now we examine how to leverage the previous achievement in the context of TFS Build.
We will examine the solution in a top-down fashion: first the build definition, than the build template, finally the MSBuild target file. The only drawback, is the lack of correlation between the version number appearing in the output assemblies with the Team Build Identifier; this will be correct with the next post .</description></item><item><title>Increment Version for Changed Assemblies only – First part</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/23/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-first-part/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/23/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-first-part/</guid><description>This is something I did in the past (Build incrementale e numeri di versione [ITA] &amp;nbsp; ), and it came out recently on Stack Overflow &amp;nbsp; , so I will take the time to describe how to do this in details.
The solution is design around MSBuild: leveraging some extension points, you trigger the custom code that increments some version number in AssemblyInfo.cs, subject to the same conditions that triggers code compiling.</description></item><item><title>Build workspace issue</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/02/build-workspace-issue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/02/build-workspace-issue/</guid><description>Some days ago, I got an email from a colleague about a build issue. Here is what she wrote me.
Hi Giulio,
After bringing back the build agents of ___, we’ve experienced below problem
I’ve mentioned you this problem before, we’ve experienced the same when started to use ____ for first time.
Only deleting the workspaces + physical folders fixed it.
I know that many Build Master and TFS Administrators have seen the Unable to create the workspace ___ due to a mapping conflict.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Linux builds in TFS</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/02/13/integrating-linux-builds-in-tfs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/02/13/integrating-linux-builds-in-tfs/</guid><description>Once upon a time I had to set-up a demo about integrating TFS build with Linux builds. As many knows there aren&amp;rsquo;t out-of-the-box solutions: currently there are no agents for Linux, so I had to make up something. The solution is composed by the following elements:
setup SSH on Linux write a Linux build script, saved in TFS version control modify the custom template using the Community Build Extensions adding these steps: a.</description></item></channel></rss>
