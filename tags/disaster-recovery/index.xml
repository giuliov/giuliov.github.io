It was a serious work, as they moved from a TFS 2010 SP1 to 2013 Update 3.
They have everything in one Collection, which makes a Migration Upgrade &amp;nbsp; (or attach upgrade) feasible.
We designed a new infrastructure with Disaster Recovery in mind. In the old configuration they just mirrored the databases at the storage level, in the new one, SQL Always On manages the replica.</description></item></channel></rss>
