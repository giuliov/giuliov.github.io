[Full Analysis Database Sync]:
TF276000: The current Analysis Database Sync job has exited without making any changes. Either another Analysis Database Sync job is already in progress, or the Analysis Database Sync job cannot run because an Optimize Databases job is running. The next Analysis Database Sync job will start at its scheduled time.
It shows up in the Cube Status report of the Administrative Report Pack &amp;nbsp; , and you are using them, aren&amp;rsquo;t you?</description></item><item><title>Command line tool to manage Git repositories in TFS</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2015/04/24/git-repo-management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2015/04/24/git-repo-management/</guid><description>In a previous post , I quickly touched on TfsGitAdmin.
I published the code on GitHub at https://github.com/giuliov/TfsGitAdmin and added new features to it:

It was a serious work, as they moved from a TFS 2010 SP1 to 2013 Update 3.
They have everything in one Collection, which makes a Migration Upgrade &amp;nbsp; (or attach upgrade) feasible.
We designed a new infrastructure with Disaster Recovery in mind. In the old configuration they just mirrored the databases at the storage level, in the new one, SQL Always On manages the replica.</description></item><item><title>Automating TeamProject creation (Git included)</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/28/automating-project-creation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/10/28/automating-project-creation/</guid><description>I get frequent request from my teams to create a new project, therefore I automated the task with a PowerShell script.
PowerShell Creation scripts The script algorithm goes like this:

Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) The first issue happened with BPA. It refuses starting a scan, if it sees off-line collections. Not a big deal, as I put them online just for this.
Lab Management I encountered a more serious issue with Lab Management configuration, so much that I opened a case with Microsoft Support.
I tried to change the Virtual Machine Manager server used by TFS, and I received an unpleasant HostShutdownException error.</description></item><item><title>Team field fix after update 3</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/09/18/team-field-fix-after-update-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 21:03:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/09/18/team-field-fix-after-update-3/</guid><description>We are testing the upgrade to TFS 2013 Update 3.

It was the third upgrade since I started working in this company, which means 3 upgrades in 4 months! This says something about our Development Directors which want the latest features because they need them; it is also a consequence of Product Group&amp;rsquo;s innovation pace. Call me lucky.
The DevOps movement keeps repeating: the harder to deploy, the more often you have to do it.</description></item><item><title>A small nice touch from TFS 2013.2</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/05/04/a-small-nice-touch-from-tfs-2013-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/05/04/a-small-nice-touch-from-tfs-2013-2/</guid><description>No more fussing around to move the cache folder: TFS 2013 Update 2 add a nice link at your fingertips on the Administration Console.

The limit of the latter solution is in the version number appearing in the assemblies: they have no relation with build identifiers.</description></item><item><title>Increment Version for Changed Assemblies only – Second Part</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/25/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-second-part/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/25/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-second-part/</guid><description>In the previous post we have seen how to hook into the MSBuild process, common to both the Visual Studio and the Team Foundation Server build processes. Now we examine how to leverage the previous achievement in the context of TFS Build.
We will examine the solution in a top-down fashion: first the build definition, than the build template, finally the MSBuild target file. The only drawback, is the lack of correlation between the version number appearing in the output assemblies with the Team Build Identifier; this will be correct with the next post .</description></item><item><title>Increment Version for Changed Assemblies only – First part</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/23/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-first-part/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/23/increment-version-for-changed-assemblies-only-first-part/</guid><description>This is something I did in the past (Build incrementale e numeri di versione [ITA] &amp;nbsp; ), and it came out recently on Stack Overflow &amp;nbsp; , so I will take the time to describe how to do this in details.
The solution is design around MSBuild: leveraging some extension points, you trigger the custom code that increments some version number in AssemblyInfo.cs, subject to the same conditions that triggers code compiling.</description></item><item><title>Remove TFS Feature</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/09/remove-tfs-feature/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/09/remove-tfs-feature/</guid><description>Are you shuffling around the machines of your TFS environment?

Sometimes you need to remove some configured feature, like Build or Proxy. That&amp;rsquo;s easy to do in 5 simple steps.
From the Administration Console, select the Server node (1), on the right panel click on the Remove Feature link (2), select the feature to un-configure (3), mark to enable the Remove button (4), finally press the Remove button (5).</description></item><item><title>Build workspace issue</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/02/build-workspace-issue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/04/02/build-workspace-issue/</guid><description>Some days ago, I got an email from a colleague about a build issue. Here is what she wrote me.
Hi Giulio,
After bringing back the build agents of ___, we’ve experienced below problem
I’ve mentioned you this problem before, we’ve experienced the same when started to use ____ for first time.
Only deleting the workspaces + physical folders fixed it.
I know that many Build Master and TFS Administrators have seen the Unable to create the workspace ___ due to a mapping conflict.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Linux builds in TFS</title><link>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/02/13/integrating-linux-builds-in-tfs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.casavian.eu/2014/02/13/integrating-linux-builds-in-tfs/</guid><description>Once upon a time I had to set-up a demo about integrating TFS build with Linux builds. As many knows there aren&amp;rsquo;t out-of-the-box solutions: currently there are no agents for Linux, so I had to make up something.
